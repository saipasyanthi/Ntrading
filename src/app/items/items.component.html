      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Hands stay clean longer in public life.
        Washing hands or using disinfectant less often protects the skin and saves money.
        The hands do not soften, as is the case when wearing gloves. When the 6th finger is used, all unclean contact surfaces vanish inside
      This finger is light, robust and fits in every pocket, and can be cleaned in the dishwasher.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Use it for door handles or grab bars, e.g. in buses, trains, subways, stations, cafes, public buildings, restrooms, others. Use it for switches in buses, trains, subways, stations, elevators, switches for light or at ATMs, toilets or water-taps. Pull control-ropes in underground parking.</p>
